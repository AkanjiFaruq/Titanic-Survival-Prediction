# Titanic Survival Analysis

The Titanic Survival Analysis Project aims to dive into data to uncover what factors influenced passenger survival on the Titanic. Our mission is to use Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answer critical questions.

## Objective

Understand the factors behind Titanic passenger survival through data analysis and visualization.

## Project Road Map

1. **Data Cleaning:** Load data, handle missing values, fix data types, and address outliers.

2. **EDA:** Provide summary statistics, build a correlation matrix, and visualize survival patterns.

3. **Analysis Questions:** Answer survival percentage, class-based rates, gender correlation, age insights, siblings/spouses' impact, embarkation port, fare correlation, age-class relationship, and extra insights.

## Summary

We aim to unveil Titanic's survival secrets. Deliverables include a Jupyter notebook with code, visuals, and answers, plus a presentation summarizing findings. Let's explore Titanic's data voyage together!

## Conclusion and Recommendation

The analysis presented valuable insights into how various factors can account for a passenger's survival chances on the Titanic. This is important because it gives a guide to what matters in terms of survival chances in such a situation of distress.

The survival rate was higher for passengers who boarded the ship at Cherbourg, and it was discovered that the survival rate was higher for passengers on a first-class ticket than for other types of ticket holders. However, the reasons for these outcomes remain unknown and could be a point of departure for further inquiry.
